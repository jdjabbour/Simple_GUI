# Simple_GUI
It is just a simple GUI Application that takes the text from the entry box as a string and displays it into the text box upon clicking the button.

# Simple_IP_GUI
This is a simple GUI application that can pull all of the information for both local and public networks.  You should be able to use this on any operating system but I have only tested it on Windows.  The only issue you may run into is with getting the local IP from a Linux OS since from what I have read quickly, their information is hard coded in the /etc/host directory and may skew the resulting output.  If you would like to run the code you will need to use Python 2.7.13 and will need these libraries which either come with the Python environment or can be downloaded through pip.  Libraries: socket, ipaddr, urllib, tkinter.  All in all, once you are set up you should be able to load the app onto the machine, open a command line and >python Simple_IP_GUI.py
